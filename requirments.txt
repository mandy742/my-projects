Discuss any ambiguities or omissions in the statement of requirements for this part of a ticket issuing system.

User Interaction
with regard to user selection it does not specify how the user select their destination is it through buttons, manually enter their destination or they select from what the system displays. The requirements do not specify if the user select a wrong destination what happens or if nothing is selected are they able to go back to the main menu.
The requirements do not specify how the credit card validation is checked...Is there a more detailed checklist available to check if the card is valid. If the card is not valid is the user notified and what other options does the user have besides credit card to make payments.
The user is requested to input a personal identifier, its not clear if its a security check and how its validated.
At the end of the process it does not tell how the ticket is issued is it printed or the user is sent an email or txt
